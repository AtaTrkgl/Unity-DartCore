"""
Running this code will create a csv file called
dartcore_localization.csv where the first column
contains the keys and the following columns contain
the localized values. After editing the csv run the 
"lng_file_generator.py" to turn it back to seperate
language files. Note that if you add a new language
to the game after creating the csv the conversion will
not work.
